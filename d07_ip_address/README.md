# Day 7 spec #
An ABBA is any four-character sequence which consists of a pair of two different characters followed by the reverse of that pair, such as xyyx or abba. However, the IP also must not have an ABBA within any hypernet sequences, which are contained by square brackets.

abba[mnop]qrst supports TLS (abba outside square brackets).
abcd[bddb]xyyx does not support TLS (bddb is within square brackets, even though xyyx is outside square brackets).
aaaa[qwer]tyui does not support TLS (aaaa is invalid; the interior characters must be different).
ioxxoj[asdfgh]zxcvbn supports TLS (oxxo is outside square brackets, even though it's within a larger string).



# Strategy #
Look for repeat characters
look to the neighboring characters
make sure they're the same

abba
 bb
a  a

# Tactics #
find to characters together that are the same
look to left and right, see if they are identical
