# moving stuff around efficiently #

## constraints ##
must always carry at least one object with me

What does this mean? 
need odd number of items, to bring items up?

can't get downstairs without at least two items

Chips burn when:
they are unpaired with a generator on their floor, AND
there is another unpaired generator on the floor.

Chips are safe when alone
Chips are safe when paired with their generator

No item can move more than one floor.

I need a data structure that can check safety, and maybe make paths?

I need a checksum for each position on the map, and steps that have been tried from that position.
