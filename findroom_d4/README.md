# examples #

aaaaa-bbb-z-y-x-123[abxyz] is a real room because the most common letters are a (5), b (3), and then a tie between x, y, and z, which are listed alphabetically.
a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-987[abcde] is a real room because although the letters are all tied (1 of each), the first five are listed alphabetically.
not-a-real-room-404[oarel] is a real room.
totally-real-room-200[decoy] is not.

# tactics #

steps to solve.
1.  parse room.  get name, number, and checksum.

2.  get checksum
sort letters by count, then alphabetically.
Maybe Room is a class.

Maybe use a hash?

score each room as 0 or room number, based on the checksum.

# strategy #

add up all the rooms, since the object described above is foolproof!
